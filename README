# should have the default table name be configurable
# don't really need to namespace the 'flavor' column; it's already polymorphic
# auto-generate the migration for the One True Table
# need to reflect to override the associations
# should require validation of flavor; we could even make sure it's one of the indicated flavors
  by tracking associations
# assumes the existance of the UnifiedUpload class
